<h3> Green Day: "Good Riddance" </h3>

<p> Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road </p>

<p> Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go </p>

<p> So make the best of this test, and don't ask why </p>

<p> It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time </p>

<p> It's something unpredictable, but in the end that's right, </p>

<p> I hope you had the time of your life. </p>

<p> So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind </p>

<p> Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time </p>

<p> Tattoos and memories and dead skin on trial </p>

<p> Through what it's worth it was worth all the while </p>

<p> It's something unpredictable, but in the end that's right, </p>

<p> I hope you had the time of your life. </p>

<p> It's something unpredictable, but in the end that's right, </p>

<p> I hope you had the time of your life. </p>

<p> It's something unpredictable, but in the end that's right, </p>

<p> I hope you had the time of your life. </p>
